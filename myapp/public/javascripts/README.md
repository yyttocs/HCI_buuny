# ChocolateBunny
3D bunny made with WebGL

This was made in an Interactive Graphics course at LSU using WebGL.

1) Ensure that your browser is capable of running WebGL and supports "canvas"
   (I recommend Google Chrome)
2) Open up the file "Viewer.html" in your browser and you will be able to play with the model
3) Enjoy!
